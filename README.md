### 🍽️ **Zomato-Food-Delivery-Data-Analysis with Interactive Dashboard**
A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore zomato food delivery data.

### **Purpose**
This project explores customer ordering behavior, restaurant types, and spending patterns using a real-world Zomato dataset. Python was used for data cleaning and exploratory visualizations, while Power BI was used to create a professional interactive dashboard that helps identify key metrics, trends, and recommendations for business decisions.

### **Tech Stack**

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
•	Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br>
•	Python – Used for Data wrangling, cleansing, analysis.<br>
•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br>
•	Pandas – Used for Tabular data manipulation.<br>
•	Matplotlib/Seaborn –  For Data visualization in notebook.<br>

### **Data Source**

- Rows: 148
- Columns: 12
- Fields: `Restaurant Type`, `Online Order`, `Rating`, `Votes`, `Approx Cost`, `Location`, etc.
- Source: Provided as `Zomato_data.csv`
